For controlling of the motors, Maxonâ€™s ESCON Module 50/5 Motor Controller is used, which is a powerful 4-Quadrant PWM Servo Controller, capable of recording and controlling the angular velocity and current of the motor in real time. 
It is capable of operating in the following modes 
speed control (closed loop), 
speed control (open loop), and 
current. 
The ESCON Module 50/5 is designed to be commanded by an analog set value and features extensive analog and digital I/O functionality. It is used  for controlling maxon motors
